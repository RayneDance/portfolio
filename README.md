# whoami

I am an IT professional from Austin, TX.  I currently work for AVIT Partners in a support role, supporting point-of-sale systems for a number of major restaurant chains that span the US, as well as being present in London and France.  I've been a computer nerd since middle school, and have been working in IT since shortly after high school, when I briefly worked for HostGator.

I've been coding off and on for about 15 years, mostly for fun.  I tried the college thing, but it wasn't something that I could make work.  Aside from what I learned in my Intro to Computer Science class, I'm mostly self taught.

I tend to want to work in a Linux environment, but find myself pigeon holed into Windows.  I'm pretty good with both Windows and Linux, and can almost make my way around OSX.

## Languages and profiles.

Currently most familiar with JavaScript and Python.
